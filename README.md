## About GigPlanr

### A webapp for musicians, by musicians.
GigPlanr was designed with musicians in mind, to take the guesswork out of planning their next gig.
At it's core, it's a setlist helper, to help artists plan their sets out better, and avoid that awkward moment when they didn't realize they went over time.
